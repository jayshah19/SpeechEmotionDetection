# SpeechEmotionDetection

I used the Python library Libros for my project. A Python module called Libros is used to analyse audio and music. It standardises interfaces and names and provides a flatter package layout, backwards compatibility, modular functions, and understandable code. Use the RAVDESS dataset and the Sklearn packages to construct a model for voice emotion recognition. I create a model with an MLPClassifier that can identify emotions in audio recordings.

I utilised the RAVDESS dataset for my project. In this dataset, 7356 files were evaluated on emotional validity, intensity, and sincerity by 247 people ten times. The total dataset, which comes from 24 actors, is 24.8GB; however, I have decreased the sampling rate for each file.
